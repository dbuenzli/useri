Useri — Declarative user input for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Useri gathers user input as [React][1] signals and events. 

Useri can be used with different backends. The library comes
with a backend based on [Tsdl][3] and a JavaScript backend that 
depends on [js_of_ocaml][4].

Useri and its backends depend on [React][1] and [Gg][2]. They are
distributed under the BSD3 license.
