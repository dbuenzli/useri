* Time.span rather use ms ? 
* Add locale lookup
* Add open_uri
* Make it independent of Fut.
* Surface, make it independent from Gl. I.e. we may what to use 
  that for Canvas aswell.
* Minimal examples.
* Multi-surfaces ? An approach would be to keep the events as 
  they are but have a notion of active surface.
* Tsdl, fix any_repeat, stops after multikey.
* Tsdl, fix set_clipboard, doesn't seem to survive program exit.
* Support for touch.
